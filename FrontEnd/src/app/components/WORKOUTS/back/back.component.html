  <h2>Types of Back Workouts</h2>
  <ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">Deadlift - a movement in which your hips hinge backward to lower down and pick up a weighted
      barbell or kettlebell from the floor. Your back is flat throughout the movement. Some benefits of performing deadlifts
      include strengthening and gaining more definition in your upper and lower back, glutes, and hamstrings.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Pull Up - an exercise in which one hangs by the hands from a support (such as a horizontal bar)
      and pulls oneself up until the chin is level with the support specifically : such an exercise done with the palms facing
      outward — compare chin-up.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Seated Row - an exercise you can do with a weight machine to work the muscles in your upper
      back. Specifically, the seated row targets the muscles in your upper back and also the latissimus dorsi — a muscle
      on the outer side of the chest wall.</ul>
