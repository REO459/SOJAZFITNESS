      <p>5k - Under this 5K run training schedule, you'll spend some of your time walking.
        For instance, during week one on run/walk days, you'll run for 15 seconds and then walk for 45 seconds, repeating
        that cycle for 30 minutes. As the weeks progress, you'll gradually increase time spent running and reduce the time spent walking.</p>
      <p>Jump Rope - Lightly grip the handles of the jump rope.
        Relax the shoulders and keep the elbows close to the torso.
        Gently bend the knees.
        Rotate the rope from the wrist and keep a smooth arc as the rope passes overhead.
        Jump low to reduce impact on the knees and ankles. </p>
      <p>Burpees - Stand upright.
        Squat, placing the hands on the ground.
        Jump the legs back so they are straight.
        Jump the legs to return into the squat position.
        Stand up.
        Jump in place.
        Repeat. </p>

      <p>Incline Bench Press - pulling your shoulder blades back and down, grabbing the bar with your hands a little wider
        than shoulder-width apart, lowering the barbell to your upper chest, and pressing the bar back up to the starting position. </p>
      <p>Chest Dip - Grab the parallel bars and jump up, straighten your arms
        Lower your body by bending your arms while leaning forward
        Dip down until your shoulders are below your elbows

      <p>Forearm Plank - Rest your forearms on the floor, with your elbows directly underneath your shoulders and hands facing forward so that your arms are parallel.
        Extend your legs out behind you and rest your toes on the floor. Your body should form one straight line from your shoulders to your heels.
        Squeeze your entire core, glutes, and quads, and tuck your butt under a little to keep your lower back straight. Make sure you are not dropping your hips or hiking your butt up high toward the ceiling.
        Position your head so that your neck is in a neutral position and your gaze is on your hands.
        Hold this position.</p>
      <p>Russian Twist - Sit with your knees bent out in front of you, feet flexed, and heels on the floor.
        Hold your hands to your chest and lean your torso back until you feel your abdominal muscles engage. For an extra challenge, add a dumbbell (as pictured).
        Slowly twist your torso from right to left. Remember to keep your core tight (and breathe!) throughout. This is one rep. </p>
      <p>Butterfly Sit-up - Lie faceup with the soles of your feet together, knees bent out to sides. Reach your arms overhead. This is starting position.
        Using your core, roll your body up until you are sitting upright. Reach forward to touch your toes. That's one rep.
        Slowly lower back down to starting position and continue immediately into the next rep.</p>

      <p>Weighted Back Squat - Load a barbell on your traps and stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Your gaze should be ahead, your chest should be proud, and your toes should be pointed slightly out.
        Sit back into your hips, bend your knees, and drop down toward the floor. Ensure that your knees move slightly out, and do not collapse in.
        Lower until your thighs are parallel to the ground — or as far down as your mobility allows — then push back up to the starting position.</p>
      <p>Walking Lunges - Start with your feet together. Hold a dumbbell in each hand if you want to perform a weighted walking lunge.
        Keeping your chest proud and gaze straight ahead, step forward, lunging with your right leg until your thigh is parallel to the ground.
        Push up through your right heel, coming back up to the starting position.
        Continue forward with the left leg.
        Gently bend the knees.
        Rotate the rope from the wrist and keep a smooth arc as the rope passes overhead.
        Jump low to reduce impact on the knees and ankles. </p>
      <p>Glute Bridge - Lie on your back with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor, and your arms down at your sides.
        Inhale and push through all four corners of your feet, engaging your core, glutes, and hamstrings to press your hips toward the ceiling.
        Pause at the top, then slowly release back to the starting position. </p>

      <p>Push ups- get down on all fours, extend your legs behind you, and lower your upper body. Hold this position for
        a few seconds and push yourself back up parallel to the floor.</p>
      <p>Overhaed Press- the starting position by standing with your barbell tucked underneath your chin and your hands
        close to your shoulders and palms facing upwards. Extend your arms to raise the barbell above your head.
        Wait a few seconds before gradually lowering the barbell.</p>
      <p>Crab Walk - crawl by moving one hand along with the opposite foot and repeating on the other side. It’ll takes
        some practice to master, but it’s a worthy inclusion to to any full-body workout.</p>
